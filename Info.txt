TODO:
implement the "Graphics" implemintation of PDFGraphics (one idea is to store all drawing operations (since they are line/vector type operations, write them to an SVG, load them up and draw the SVG. Floating point operations, partial pixel drawing, scaling, Image drawing, etc. is all taken care of. The only thing is it will probably be slow).

Cleanup StandardDecrypter so it's code is more efficient and handles errors properly, also update the documentation and parameter names
See what can be done with NativeFont, if OCR can be done or if Geometry should have a special function only for NativeFont.
Update TODOs in various classes

Go through and make sure licenses and authors are noted and given credit to and update documentation so that it portains to BlackBerry PDF Renderer.
Add resources for internationalization.

Add preprocessors
Figure out how to add support for text selection


PREPROCESSORS:
USE_FIXED32 (Uses Fixed32 instead of float if precision lost is not above a certain theshold, maybe a special class that can switch between them.)
NATIVE_SOFTREFERENCE (If SoftReference ever gets added natively this will ignore the built-in implementation).
NATIVE_CHARSET_ENCODER (If CharsetEncoder ever gets added natively this will ignore the built-in implementation).
USE_LCMS_LIBRARY (Use an external LCMS library instead of the built in library, this is perferred because it is more up-to-date and is less error prone [trying to hack together a color converter that has to be able to load ICC profiles is not a light task]), the only real manual operation that needs to be done besides setting this DEFINE is to link the library as a dependency into the project.) UPDATE-This is not really valid right now since the library has been changed to just using the library.
//TODO: add more preprocessors


NOTES:
-Way more helper classes then desired, of possible cut down on them, intergrate functionality, cross fingers and hope something similar comes out natively...
-ICC color space is going to drive me up a wall, why do standards tell you everything but what you NEED to know? UPDATE: Little CMS Engine has saved me, for a bit.
