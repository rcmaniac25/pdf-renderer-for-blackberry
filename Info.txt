Implement ICC_ColorSpace.java
Implement ICC_Profile.java (intergrate ICC file format reading into this)
Figure out Paint type (make sure it has "int getColor()" to get the main paint color, format 0x00RRGGBB)
Create AffineTransform and replace in PDFTextFormat and PDFGraphics
Get a Path (graphics) system implemented.
Update PDFPaint, PDFRenderer with Path system

Cleanup StandardDecrypter so it's code is more efficient and handles errors properly, also update the documentation and parameter names
Add preprocessors



PREPROCESSORS:
USE_FIXED32 (Uses Fixed32 instead of float if precision lost is not above a certain theshold)
NATIVE_SOFTREFERENCE (If SoftReference ever gets added natively this will ignore the built-in implementation).
NATIVE_CHARSET_ENCODER (If CharsetEncoder ever gets added natively this will ignore the built-in implementation).


NOTES:
-Way more helper classes then desired, of possible cut down on them, intergrate functionality, cross fingers and hope something similar comes out natively...
-ICC color space is going to drive me up a wall, why do standards tell you everything but what you NEED to know?
