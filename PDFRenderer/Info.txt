TODO:
Finish FilePicker
-Fix "seperator" use in list-field (figure out how to ignore seperators)
-Make sure that dialog always uses full size
-Make sure that file-size field is displayed
-Implement menu
-For thumbnail mode, adjust how focus, drawing, and interaction are handled (basically subdivide it)
-Test
Make sure all PDFs work.

Do some tests (and updates) that involve PDFImage to make sure that it works (since it wasn't exactly "changed" to the current revision)

implement the "Graphics" implementation of PDFGraphics (one idea is to store all drawing operations (since they are line/vector type operations, write them to an SVG, load them up and draw the SVG. Floating point operations, partial pixel drawing, scaling, Image drawing, etc. is all taken care of. The only thing is it will probably be slow).
	Use quality, so if quality is high for Graphics object, use SVG/OpenVG/OpenGL/etc. to draw, for low quality round the points and draw with normal Graphics object.
	Note in OS 6.0 support for OpenVG has been added, this is basically a OpenGL-like, Graphics-using-float system. Release notes states it adds support for fill and stroke elements in SVG and it seems to support them itself so make sure that the SVG renderer supports these elements in the proper version and that the fastest implementation takes priority.
	If in OS 5.0 support then use OpenGL, take a look at GLUT|ES to see how fonts are drawn.

Finish localization
-Finish general localization (com.sun.pdfview.ResourceManager.getResource(com.sun.pdfview.ResourceManager.LOCALIZATION).getString(com.sun.pdfview.i18n.ResourcesResource.COLORSPACE_PATTERN_NAME)):

-All "add code" (with resources) needs to be implemented or rewritten so it uses formatting
Try to get Geometry.isFilled to properly handle bézier curves properly
Use preprocessor to remove "debug" code
Rewrite StandardDecrypter so it works properly with BlackBerry's crypto classes, handles error properly, and update the documentation to reflect changes and explain what the class is doing
See what can be done with NativeFont, if OCR can be done or if Geometry should have a special function only for NativeFont.
Update TODOs in various classes

Modify PDFViewer so that it supports Torch (Trackpad) and other 4.5/4.6/4.7 handsets (also check to make sure that if a CLICK event is used that it is not used on non-SurePress screens like the Torch)

Go through and make sure licenses and authors are noted and given credit to and update documentation so that it portains to BlackBerry PDF Renderer.
Add resources for internationalization.

Preprocessor support
Add search functionality
Add text extraction

Figure out how to add support for text selection in PDF Viewer
Better compatibility for newer versions of PDF


Defines:
USE_FIXED32 (Uses Fixed32 instead of float if precision lost is not above a certain theshold, maybe a special class that can switch between them.)
NATIVE_SOFTREFERENCE (If SoftReference ever gets added natively this will ignore the built-in implementation).
//TODO: add more preprocessors


NOTES:
-Strings follow the guidelines listed in "http://docs.blackberry.com/en/developers/deliverables/3299/JDE_4.5_Fundamentals_Guide.pdf" which state not to use static final for Strings because then Strings need to be loaded multiple times and multiple instances of the same String exist.
-If accuracy becomes a problem with transforms, change AffineTransform to use doubles (like the original)
-PDFImage is drastically different in this (BlackBerry) version compared to the (J2SE) version. This is because BlackBerry doesn't have all the same image/color classes that J2SE has. The native image system is used to handle as much as possible.
